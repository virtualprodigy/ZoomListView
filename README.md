# ZoomListView
This is a custom list view that makes each list item appear to move closer to the screen as it appoarches the middle of the listview. Added the com.virtualprodigy.zoomlistviewmodule.ZoomListView to your xml layout. This listview will work with 
any adapter a standard listview is compatible with.
